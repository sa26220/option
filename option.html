        <p>I have used the following CSS in my website:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Multi-column layout: I used multi-column layout in the main body, in the very begining. I used it to break off the paragraph into 2 columns, in a side by side layout.</li>
            <li>Linear gradient: I used linear gradient throughout the whole website page as a background. It goes from top to bottom, from lightcoral to lightblue.</li>
            <li>@font-face rule: I used the @font-face rule on the paragraph tags of this website, which are the columns in the begining. It is customed and labeled as 'quicksandRegular' in the CSS page.</li>
            <li>Text and box shadow: I used text shadow in the title, the h1 of the CSS page. It's shadow is a white color. I also used it in box shadow for the columns in the begining, which also has a shadow effect of white.</li>
            <li>CSS structural pseudo-classes: I used the first-child pseudo-class in the unordered list section of the CSS page to change the font color. It is also visible in the website page as the first-child of the unordered list is printed out in white.</li>
            <li>CSS attribute: I used the CSS attribute selector on the bottom of the website. I used it to select the target attribute of tag a. I used it to select the target attribute and change its font color to dark red.</li>
        </ol>
